# Prediction-framework-for-acupuncture-based-on-SVM

These MATLAB codes applied to establish SVC and SVR prediction models for the prediction of acupuncture responders and non-responders, as well as the symptoms relief. In the file named SVC_costom_code.mat, we performed three parts of work: 1) the optimal feature selection threshold determination, SVC model establishment and predicting features identification. While in the file named SVR_costom_code.mat, we established the prediction models based on the identified predicting features to forecast the improvement of the Symptom Index of Dyspepsia score after treatment. In the file named validation_in_indpedent_set.mat, we validated the generalizability of predictive features in the independent validation set.
These prediction models were developed based on the Support Vector Machine Algorithm. See details about SVM in the folder named matlab_libsvm or https://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~cjlin/Libsvm.
